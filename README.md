# Executive Project Summary
* What doing? Hacking a cheap IoT security camera  
    * Cameras nowadays are affordable and easy to set up. Full of wifi features. Popular. (Delve into convenience and sense of security)
    * Cameras are vulnerable to different cybersecurity threats, hackers can use different techniques to access illegaly to a camera to capture images and intercept videos chatting.  
* Important? Compromised device can lead to unwanted spying, learning patterns of tenants (break in when no one is home; lost sense of security).  
     * Controlling the security camera by using remote access tools can allow the third person remotely to monitor users on their daily activities without realizing it.
--------------------------------
In the modern age, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more common. One portion of this growing market includes security cameras. Through research and development, Wi-Fi enabled cameras have become quite affordable. They also have a growing list of features that are attractive to consumers. Some examples of the convenient tools available include: remote two-way communications, remote access to live video, integration with Alexa and IFTTT, cloud storage, sd storage, and much more.  
  
Our main goal is to perform a penetration test on a EZVIZ CTQ2C 720p security camera. 
## Goals and objectives
* Build experience practicing skills learned in coursework
* Pentest camera with a variety of methodologies
    * Intercept video/remotely control device
    * Test if vulnerable to spoofed network
    * Create a botnet using multiple cameras
    Examples of useful typeys of attack for this project:
    * Trojan horse attack, this attack uses (RAT) and provides hidden access.
    * Clickjacking attack:
* Deliver best practice guide, highlighting vulnerabilities to minimize threat space
## Merit of the Project
* With IoT cameras gaining popularity, finding and sharing weaknesses so they can be patched is benficial to everyone  
* It is important fot IT companies and indviusles to know that how to protect their assets during all of the current revloution in the IT industry when their cameras are connected to the interent. 
* If no vulnerabilities are found, can add comfort to the idea of consumers trusting these devices

# Project-oriented Risk List
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Brick security camera (30) | 6 | 5 | It's possible that we may brick the security camera while trying to gain access to it via the hardware |
|Corrupt micro SD card (20) | 4 | 5 | It's possible that we may corrupt an SD card while attempting to gain access to the device using the SD card |
|Team member being unavailable/unwilling to help (32) | 8 | 4 | There may be a loss in productivity if one or more team members are unable to cooperate |
|Cannot attack via network (15) | 3 | 5 | There may be no network-based vulnerabilities |
|Cannot attack via micro SD card (15) | 3 | 5 | There may be no way to attack through the SD card |

# Project Methodology
Perform research on how to best approach this project.  
*Ask for further detail here*
## Literature Review
|Resource  | Author(s) | Importance | Signifcance to the group |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
| https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg#android-testing-guide | OWASP | There are in-depth guides on testing mobile device applications based on the operating system  | This is useful to the group because the device we are testing has an application on both android and iOS|

# Resources/Technology needed
Spoofing devices - pineapple from Hale? -See Echo Example
Micro SD cards
*hacking tools. Need to do research*

|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|EZVIZ CTQ2C| no | Everyone | this allows everyone to do independent research |
| SD card | no | Everyone | Needed for the camera to be able to store recordings, does not come included with device |
| Iphone | no | Mohammed & Khalid | Needed to investigate the iOS app |
| Android Device | no | Jose & Thomas | Needed to investigate the android app |
| burp suite | no | Christian | Needed to test the webapp |
