# Progress Report (5 / 2 / 2019)
## Overview
**Vulnerability Scan using Armitage**  
I thought it would be a good idea to run armitage and see what kind of exploits it would recommend to use against the camera. Armitage was a quick and easy way to see if there would be any easy exploits to leverage the camera. _jgherndz_


**Attempt at changing the Camera default password**


**Connecting to Camera via Port 8000**



**Using TCP Connection to connect to Camera via Port 8000**



## Outcomes
**Vulnerability Scan using Armitage**
Armitage was able to recommend a few attacks after it completed its initial scan and found the camera. There were 3 categories that armitage found unfortunately none of the exploits worked. _jgherndz_

**Attempt at changing the Camera default password**


**Connecting to Camera via Port 8000**



**Using TCP Connection to connect to Camera via Port 8000**


## Hinderances
**Vulnerability Scan using Armitage**
The hinderance would be that the attacks that Armitage found were not succcesful. _jgherndz_
