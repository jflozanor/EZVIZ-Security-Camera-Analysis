# EZVIZ Security Camera Analysis
## Executive Summary
In the modern age, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more common. One portion of this growing market includes security cameras. Through research and development, Wi-Fi enabled cameras have become quite affordable. They also have a growing list of features that are attractive to consumers. Some examples of the convenient tools available include remote two-way communications, remote access to live video, integration with Alexa and IFTTT, cloud storage, SD storage, and much more.  
  
Our main goal is to perform a penetration test on an EZVIZ CTQ2C 720p security camera. Our scope will include testing the vulnerabilities of the camera itself, along with utilizing other devices to attack it over the network. These can be the smartphone companion app, web app, and other IoT devices. We will not be directly pen testing the official servers that host the cloud service and allow remote camera access.  
  
A compromised security camera can lead to unwanted spying and the patterning of tenants' activities. If remote access is achieved by a malicious individual, the user could be spied on without ever knowing it. In the modern day of sacrificing security for convenience, it's important for consumers to remain aware of the dangers around them. To help people best defend themselves, we aim to present a report of our findings and an establishment of best practices for securing IoT cameras.

Illegal camera surveillance has adverse effects on society, from the perspective that people feel their privacy is ever invaded via camera systems. Generally, the fact that people are becoming more computer literate cases of hacking cameras are rapidly being common. Industries like the hotels and surveillance units suffer greatly. An instance of the hotel sector, once their customersâ€™ privacy is invaded through camera hackings, the hotels credibility is lost, thus they end up losing financially.
